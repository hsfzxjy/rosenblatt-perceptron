# rosenblatt-perceptron

## Overview

Given a function `f(x; p): Rn -> R` where `p` is a vector defined by user, the space `Rn` will be separated into two parts `{x | f(x; p) > 0}` and `{x | f(x; p) < 0}`, which can be regarded as two categories. The project implements a classifer based on Rosenblatt Perceptron. Fed with large amounts of data and their labels, it will output the core parameters (the weight) of the model. A tester is also packed to calculate the correctness of the model.

As comparison we select two versions of `f`, linear and non-linear ones. Rosenblatt Perceptron is actually a linear model, so accuracy will be better for data generated by linear `f`.

 + linear version: `f(x; p) = x.dot(p)`
 + non-linear version: `f(x; p) = (x1 - p1) * ... * (xn - pn)`

## Usage

```bash
# Choose a random vector as parameter, you can also specify it manually by writing it into file `param`
$ make init
# Test linear data
$ make tt
# Test non-linear data
$ make nltt
```
